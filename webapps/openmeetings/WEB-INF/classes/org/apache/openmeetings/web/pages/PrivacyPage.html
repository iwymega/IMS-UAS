		<h2>OpenMeetings Privacy Statement</h2>
		<p>Effective date: May 25, 2018</p>
		<p>
			Thanks for entrusting OpenMeetings with your information.
			Holding onto your private information is a serious responsibility,
			and we want you to know how we're handling it.
		</p>
		<h3>The short version</h3>
		<p>
			We collect your information only with your consent; we only collect the
			minimum amount of personal information that is necessary to fulfill the
			purpose of your interaction with us; we don't sell it to third parties;
			and we only use it as this Privacy Statement describes. If you're visiting
			us from the EU: we comply with the General Data Protection Regulation,
			<a href="https://www.eugdpr.org/">https://www.eugdpr.org/</a>.
		</p>
		<p>Of course, the short version doesn't tell you everything, so please read on for more details!</p>
		<h3>What information OpenMeetings collects and why</h3>
		<h4>Information from website browsers</h4>
		<p>
			In general we do not collect personal information. The only information collected
			is access logs: i.e. when the page was accessed. This information is required to
			perform security analysis.
		</p>
		<h4>Information from users with accounts</h4>
		<p>
			If you <strong>create an account</strong>, we require some basic information at the time of account
			creation. You will create your own username and password, and we will ask you for a
			valid email account. You also have the option to give us more information if you want
			to, and this may include "User Personal Information."
		</p>
		<p>
			"User Personal Information" is any information about one of our users which could, alone
			or together with other information, personally identify him or her. Information such as a
			username and password, an email address, a real name, and a photograph are examples of "User Personal Information."
		</p>
		<h5>Why do we collect this?</h5>
		<ul>
			<li>We need your User Personal Information to create your account, and to provide the services you request.</li>
			<li>We use your User Personal Information, specifically your user name, to identify you on OpenMeetings.</li>
			<li>We use it to fill out your profile and share that profile with other users if you ask us to.</li>
			<li>We will only use your email address to send calendar event notifications, meeting room invitations, and personal messages.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>What information OpenMeetings does not collect</h3>
		<p>
			We do not intentionally collect <strong>sensitive personal information</strong>, such as social security numbers, genetic data,
			health information, or religious information. Although OpenMeetings does not request or intentionally collect
			any sensitive personal information, we realize that you might store this kind of information in your account,
			such as in “My offerings” and/or “My interests” fields. If you store any sensitive personal information on our
			servers, you are consenting to our storage of that information on our servers.
		</p>
		<p>
			We do not intentionally collect information that is <strong>stored in your profile</strong> or other free-form content inputs,
			such as room files, documents, calendar events, or messages. Such Information belongs to you, and you are responsible
			for it. OpenMeetings does not access
			private information unless required to for security or maintenance, or for support reasons, with the consent of 
			the repository owner.
		</p>
		<h3>How we share the information we collect</h3>
		<p>
			We <strong>do not</strong> share, sell, rent, or trade User Personal Information with third parties for
			their commercial purposes.
		</p>
		<p>We do not disclose User Personal Information outside OpenMeetings.</p>
		<p>We do not host advertising on OpenMeetings.</p> 
		<p>
			We may share User Personal Information with your permission, so we can perform services you have requested,
			for example so that other users can find you and so that your name is listed in chats.
		</p>
		<h3>Our use of cookies and tracking</h3>
		<h4>Cookies</h4>
		<p>
			OpenMeetings uses cookies to make interactions with our service easy and meaningful.
			We use cookies (and similar technologies, like HTML5 localStorage) to keep you logged in, remember
			your preferences, and provide information for future development of OpenMeetings.
		</p>
		<p>
			A cookie is a small piece of text that our web server stores on your computer or mobile device, which
			your browser sends to us when you return to our site. Cookies do not necessarily identify you if you are
			merely visiting OpenMeetings; however, a cookie may store a unique identifier for each logged in user.
			The cookies OpenMeetings sets are essential for the operation of the website, or are used for performance
			or functionality. By using our website, you agree that we can place these types of cookies on your computer
			or device. If you disable your browser or device’s ability to accept cookies, you will not be able to log
			in or use OpenMeetings’s services.
		</p>
		<h4>Google Analytics</h4>
		<p>
			We may use Google Analytics as a third party tracking service, but we don’t use it to track you individually
			or collect your User Personal Information. We use Google Analytics to collect information about how our website
			performs and how our users, in general, navigate through and use OpenMeetings. This helps us evaluate our users
			use of OpenMeetings; compile statistical reports on activity; and improve our content and website performance.
		</p>
		<p>
			Google Analytics gathers certain simple, non-personally identifying information over time, such as your IP address,
			browser type, internet service provider, referring and exit pages, timestamp, and similar data about your use of
			OpenMeetings. We do not link this information to any of your personal information such as your user name.
		</p>
		<p>
			OpenMeetings will not, nor will we allow any third party to, use the Google Analytics tool to track our users individually;
			collect any User Personal Information other than IP address; or correlate your IP address with your identity.
			Google provides further information about its own privacy practices and offers a 
			<a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">browser add-on to opt out of Google Analytics tracking</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Certain pages on our site may set other third party cookies. For example, we may embed content, such as videos,
			from another site that sets a cookie. While we try to minimize these third party cookies, we can’t always control
			what cookies this third party content sets.
		</p>
		<h4>Tracking</h4>
		<p>
			"<a href="http://donottrack.us/">Do Not Track</a>" is a privacy preference you can set in your browser if you do not want online services to
			collect and share certain kinds of information about your online activity from third party tracking services.
			We do not track your online browsing activity on other online services over time and we do not permit third-party
			services to track your activity on our site beyond our basic Google Analytics tracking, which you may opt out of
			<a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">here</a>.
			Because we do not share this kind of data with third party services or permit this kind of third party data collection
			on OpenMeetings for any of our users, and we do not track our users on third-party websites ourselves, we do not need
			to respond differently to an individual browser's <a href="http://donottrack.us/">Do Not Track</a> setting.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you are interested in turning on your browser’s privacy and Do Not Track settings, the Do Not Track website has
			browser-specific instructions.
		</p>
		<h3>How OpenMeetings secures your information</h3>
		<p>
			OpenMeetings takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect User Personal Information from unauthorized access,
			alteration, or destruction; maintain data accuracy; and help ensure the appropriate use of User Personal Information.
			We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during
			transmission and once we receive it.
		</p>
		<p>
			No method of transmission, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
		</p>
		<h3>OpenMeetings's global privacy practices</h3>
		<p>
			<strong>Information that we collect will be stored and processed in the country where the server is located</strong> in accordance
			with this Privacy Statement. However, we understand that we have users from different countries and regions with
			different privacy expectations, and we try to meet those needs.
		</p>
		<p>
			We provide the same standard of privacy protection to all our users around the world, regardless of their country
			of origin or location, and we are proud of the levels of notice, choice, accountability, security, data integrity,
			access, and recourse we provide.
		</p>
		<p>In particular:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>OpenMeetings provides clear methods of unambiguous, informed consent at the time of data collection, when we do
				collect your personal data.</li>
			<li>We collect only the minimum amount of personal data necessary, unless you choose to provide more. We encourage
				you to only give us the amount of data you are comfortable sharing.</li>
			<li>Users can choose whether or not to make their profiles visible to other users.</li>
			<li>We offer you simple methods of accessing, correcting, or deleting the data we have collected.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Resolving Complaints</h3>
		<p>
			If you have concerns about the way OpenMeetings is handling your User Personal Information, please contact your
			system administrator immediately.
		</p>
		<h4>Dispute Resolution Process</h4>
		<p>
			In the unlikely event that a dispute arises between you and OpenMeetings regarding our handling of your User
			Personal Information, we will do our best to resolve it.
		</p>
		<h3>How we respond to compelled disclosure</h3>
		<p>
			OpenMeetings may disclose personally-identifying information or other information we collect about you to law
			enforcement in response to a valid subpoena, court order, warrant, or similar government order, or when we believe
			in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect our property or rights, or those of third parties
			or the public at large.
		</p>
		<p>
			In complying with court orders and similar legal processes, OpenMeetings strives for transparency. When permitted,
			we will make a reasonable effort to notify users of any disclosure of their information, unless we are prohibited
			by law or court order from doing so, or in rare, exigent circumstances.
		</p>
		<h3>How you can access and control the information we collect</h3>
		<p>
			If you're already a OpenMeetings user, you may access, update, alter, or delete your basic user profile information
			by <strong>editing your user profile</strong> (https://&lt;yourserver:port&gt;/openmeetings/#profile/edit) or contacting your
			system administrator.
		</p>
		<h4>Data Retention and Deletion</h4>
		<p>OpenMeetings will retain User Personal Information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services.</p>
		<p>
			We may retain certain User Personal Information indefinitely, unless you delete it or request its deletion.
			For example, we don’t automatically delete inactive user accounts, so unless you choose to delete your account,
			we will retain your account information indefinitely.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you would like to cancel your account or delete your User Personal Information, you may do so in <strong>your
			user profile</strong> (https://&lt;yourserver:port&gt;/openmeetings/#profile/edit). We will remove your personal details
			immediately.
		</p>
		<h3>How we communicate with you</h3>
		<p>
			We will use your email address to communicate with you, if you've said that's okay, <strong>and only for the reasons
			you’ve said that’s okay</strong>. You may manage your communication preferences in your <strong>user profile</strong>
			(https://&lt;yourserver:port&gt;/openmeetings/#profile/edit).
		</p>
		<p>
			Depending on your email settings, OpenMeetings may occasionally send notification emails about upcoming events
			you have created or the ones you have been invited to, invitations to private meetings sent by users you know,
			private messages from the users you know, and some system messages configured by system administrators.
		</p>
		<h3>Changes to our Privacy Statement</h3>
		<p>
			Although most changes are likely to be minor, OpenMeetings may change our Privacy Statement from time to time.
			We will provide notification to Users of material changes to this Privacy Statement through our Website at
			least 30 days prior to the change taking effect by posting a notice on our home page or sending email to the
			email address specified in your OpenMeetings primary account. For changes to this Privacy Statement that do
			not affect your rights, we encourage visitors to check this page frequently.
